what is the tundra ecosystem,"The Tundra ecosystem is a major zone of treeless level or rolling ground found in cold regions mostly north of the Arctic Circle (Arctic tundra) or above the timberline on high mountains (alpine tundra)."
which things can be seen,"The Tundra is known for large stretches of bare ground and rock and for patchy mantles of low vegetation such as mosses, lichens, herbs, and small shrubs. This surface supports a meagre but unique variety of animals."

what is distribution or global extent of tundra biome,"The global extent of the tundra biome is considerable, accounting for roughly 10 percent of Earth's surface. The southern limit of Arctic tundra follows the northern edge of the coniferous forest belt. In North America this line lies above latitude 60° N, while in Eurasia most of it occurs north of 70° North except in eastern Siberia, where it extends southward to 60° North in Kamchatka. The northward bulge of forest in Eurasia is a result of the warmer summers that occur over that large contiguous landmass."
what is climate like in the tundra,"Tundra climates vary considerably. The most severe occur in the Arctic regions, where temperatures fluctuate from 4 °C (about 40 °F) in midsummer to -32 °C (-25 °F) during the winter months. Alpine tundra has a more moderate climate: summers are cool, with temperatures that range from 3 to 12 °C (37 to 54 °F), and winters are moderate, with temperatures that rarely fall below -18 °C (0 °F)."

how does tundra compare to other biomes,"Unlike other biomes, such as the taiga, the Arctic tundra is defined more by its low summer temperatures than by its low winter temperatures. Coastal tundra ecosystems are cooler and foggier than those farther inland. Late summer and early fall are particularly cloudy seasons because large amounts of water are available for evaporation. With the first winter freeze, however, the clear skies return."
what kind of plant life and vegitation,"The vegetation of many alpine tundras and over most of the Arctic tundra tends to be greenish brown in colour. While plants do not remain in flower for more than a few days or weeks in these environments, the blossoms are generally large in relation to the size of the plant and are rather colourful, especially in alpine habitats. The foggy tundras found along coastal areas produce matted and grassy landscapes. Algae and fungi are found along rocky cliffs, and rosette plants grow in rock cornices and shallow gravel beds. In the drier inland tundras, spongy turf and lichen heaths develop."
what type of animal wildlife are there,"Organisms of the northern alpine tundra probably evolved before those of the Arctic tundra, appearing first in the Mongolo-Tibetan Plateau. Few alpine animals, however, contributed directly to the evolution of Arctic tundra species, because physical barriers prevented the migration of species and because alpine and Arctic animals were specialized to their particular environments. However, alpine plants and some animals migrated east and west through mountain ranges to Europe and North America."
when are predators most active,"Some predatory mammals follow the seasonal patterns of their prey, whereas others obtain food near their dens. Polar bears are as much a part of the marine environment as they are of the tundra. In winter they spend much of their time on ice floes hunting seals and other animals that congregate in those locations to breed. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) capture fish and small mammals, and foxes and wolves often follow bears to feed on leftovers. In summer, foxes and wolves are found mostly on land, where they raise their young and feed on birds and small mammals."
how is the sunlight and carbon dioxide,"The flora and fauna of Arctic tundras and alpine tundras are affected by differences in day length and in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Plants and animals of alpine tundras are subjected to the same day-night regime as are other organisms at lower elevations in tropical or temperate regions, and numerous activities of these organisms are controlled by the length of the night."
how is the biological productivity,"The biological production is the total amount of biomass produced by living organisms within a given area in a specific period of time. In polar regions the greatest biological production occurs in marine waters rather than on land, and production is actually higher in the Antarctic than it is in the Arctic Ocean. Production studies of Arctic tundra lakes indicate that there are many species of algae and aquatic mosses living in the higher latitudes of the Arctic."
what are the effects human activities and climate change,"Humans have changed the landscape through the construction of residences and other structures, as well as through the development of ski resorts, mines, and roads. Hunting, oil drilling, and other activities have polluted the environment and have threatened wildlife in tundra ecosystems. Environmental scientists are concerned that the continued expansion of these activities along with the release of air pollutants, some of which deplete the ozone layer, and greenhouse gases, which hasten climate change has begun to affect the very integrity and sustainability of Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems."
when did humans first settle in the tundra,"Earth's tundra regions are harsh and remote, so fewer humans have settled there than in other environments. However, humans have a long history in the tundra. For example, the first people who went to North America from Asia more than 20,000 years ago traveled through vast tundra settings on both continents. Since then human activity in tundra ecosystems has increased, mainly through the procurement of food and building materials."
why is it called tundra,"The Finns called their treeless northern reaches the tunturi, but the concept of a vast frozen plain as a special ecological realm called tundra was developed by the Russians."
